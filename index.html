        Ingredients yields 8 servings <br />
        1 ½ cups all-purpose flour 3 ½ teaspoons baking powder 1 tablespoon
        white sugar ¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste 1 ¼ cups milk 3
        tablespoons butter, melted 1 large egg
        <br />
        Directions <br />
        Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl.
        Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix
        until smooth. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat.
        Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup
        for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2
        to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with
        remaining batter.
